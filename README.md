Pugh Lab  
June 2019  

**Cohort Overview:**  
XX cells from 29 BTSC culturers, derived from XX patients.     
XX cells from 24 primary GBM samples from 7 patients (some tumours have multiple regions/sample)  
XX/XX cells from primary tumours are malignant, XXX are normal brain, and XXX are of immune origin.   
X samples have matched BTSC culture and primary GBM.
