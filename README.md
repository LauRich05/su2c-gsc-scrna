Glioblastomas (GBM) harbour diverse populations of cells, including a rare subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that drive tumorigenesis. To characterize functional diversity within the tumor-initiating fraction of GBM, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on >69,000 GSCs cultured from the tumors of 26 patients. We observed a high degree of inter- and intra-GSC transcriptional heterogeneity that could not be fully explained by somatic alterations at the DNA level. Instead, we found GSCs mapped along a transcriptional gradient spanning two cellular states reminiscent of normal neural developmental and inflammatory wound response processes. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 drop-out screens independently recapitulated this observation, with each state characterized by unique essential genes. Further single-cell RNA-sequencing of >56,000 malignant cells from primary tumors found the majority of cancer cells organize along an astrocyte maturation gradient orthogonal to the GSC gradient yet retained expression of founder GSC transcriptional programs. Our work supports a model whereby GBM grows out of a fundamental GSC-based neural tissue regeneration and wound response transcriptional program characterized by a range of sensitive targets, promising for novel therapy development.
